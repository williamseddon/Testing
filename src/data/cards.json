Life one area, anticipate stumbling in another. Be patient and flexible as you weigh your options and juggle new challenges. Big entrances don’t always require big reactions, so practice objectivity and release the need to overcomplicate your situation. Remember, you don’t have to be busy to get things done. When you are hanging on by a thread, taking a break is the most productive thing you can do. Once you see through the game, you are free of it-- and full of second chances."

Sneaking into situations undetected, you calculate every step— slipping through backdoors and bathrooms— getting close enough to information and spin it. You read emails, gather check text messages, and even underwear. But whether you’re big-foreheaded or two- faced, concealer can only mask appearances for so long. The knives are out, and the girls are starting to point their fingers in your face. Google leaves a trace, and you can no longer defend the indefensible or stay complicit in your mess. Keeping secrets brings more stress than peace and more shame than self-esteem. Drop the act and own your shit. You can’t be everything to everyone, so accept that you’ll let people down no matter what statement you make."

      "You’re not a mistress, honey, that’s somebody else. In love with love, deep feelings and emotions don’t embarrass you. You wear your heart on your sleeve and never shy away from public displays. From sunsets to Chanel, you dream of a beautiful life full of beautiful things-- no boogawolves allowed. However, “friends” spectrum that complicates your desire for and romance. When silence dismisses is a passion your devotion as unrequited, frustration quickly spills over and spoils the fantasy. If you’re hurt, others are going to know you’re hurt. Confucius may think through a situation, but you act out, sloppy and sulky. Don’t get swept up in the excitement of a situation, but also don’t tone your dreams down for anyone. You have the choice to be an open vessel or an open wound, so take stock of what’s in front of you. Is it water? Or is it tequila?"

Though emotions, creativity and art rule the days of your life, you are not the clingy or brooding type. In fact, you love therapy! You recognize the Divine everyone and don’t know where this pure evil is coming from. Your gentle warmth is legendary and you hold space in hatred and for others to drop the poker face and be pretty or messy without overwhelming your own energy levels. It is important to pay attention to yourself too though and feel through your own feelings, positive or negative. Honor the process and give yourself the time and space to quiet your thoughts and lead from your gut. Others may point their fingers, but you act from a place of love and compassion right now in the moment."

      "You’ve got an old school attitude with no respect for nonsense. Level-headed and emotionally intelligent, you don’t let the (big) hair-trigger whims of others sway your moral compass. Oh, you’re as Italian as the Olive Garden? That’s funny? Caught in a whirlwind of stupid, you anchor your reactions with cool, common and a patient understanding of human sense dynamics. You don’t need to prove yourself to anyone. Instead, your first instinct is to protect the peace. Be firm in your personal boundaries of what is and is not acceptable. When you hang out with trash you start to smell like garbage. Right now it’s all about love and light, baby, love and light. You create diplomacy and rise above negativity when you strike a wise balance between heart and mind. Make sure you show yourself the same compassion during difficult times. Remaining reasonable does not require emotional repression, so don’t beat yourself up when the small things go wrong. Remember, when you stand, you stand with your family behind you."
