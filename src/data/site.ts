      'We’re Twins Who Tarot — two twins with big feelings, strong opinions, and a lifelong love of Tarot… plus an unhealthy fluency in Real Housewives.',
      'Real House of Tarot started as a pandemic-era passion project when we finally ended up in the same place for a long girls’ weekend. Like everyone else, we were spiraling a little — so we did what we always do: reached for mysticism and a NeNe Leakes gif.',
      'Between the two of us we bring years of study in Tarot and astrology, a design background, and just enough Housewives lore to be dangerous. The deck is original art, written and illustrated by us — made to be used, re-used, and passed around your group chat.',
      'Our hope is simple: that this deck helps you tell the truth with kindness, laugh when you need to, and get a little clearer about what happens next.',
      'Now spread your cards and MENTION IT ALL!',
